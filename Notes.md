# Notes


- Navbar
  - [ ] modal pop-up for info
  - [ ] cursor: pointer on info as well
  - [ ] careful of resizing - need a minimum height

- CardsContainer
  - [ ] grid wrap --- How do I this again? 
  
  
## Additional ideas

- Allow user to select number of cards
- Game over screen - congrats you've done it! :D 
- Links to the top right corner (YT, Twitch, Website & TOP)
