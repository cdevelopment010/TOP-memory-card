# Notes


- Navbar
  - [x] modal pop-up for info
  - [x] cursor: pointer on info as well
  - [x] careful of resizing - need a minimum height

- CardsContainer
  - [x] grid wrap --- How do I this again? 
    - [x] repeat(auto-fill/fit, minmax(200px, 1fr))


  
  
## Additional ideas

- *Allow user to select number of cards*
  - Not implementing this as I have gone with a level system
- ~~Game over screen - congrats you've done it! :D~~
- ~~restart option/next level~~
- ~~Links to the top right corner (YT, Twitch, Website & TOP)~~
